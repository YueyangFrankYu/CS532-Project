@shashj Rather odd that he says Ukraine doesn’t meet the requirements for NATO membership “because it’s occupied”
@shashj Then what's their purpose? To show that NATO has troops? The case for sending weapons to Ukraine is at least defendable (although I have my doubts that it's wise). But if you state clearly that NATO will not be involved militarily (and everybody knows that)
@shashj Why are you taking this story as a given? If the Russians had claimed something similar of Ukraine and NATO you would have called bullshit.	taking story given russian claimed something similar ukraine nato called bullshit	-0.5859	Negative

@shasslerlcsw @pooroldcripple I don't doubt that going to war in Ukraine is a bonehead idea and am vehemently opposed to U.S. bullying and belligerence. But I doubt it a conflict in Ukraine would be over quickly
